You can do this by installing the Hummingbot software and running it on your machine.\\n\\n2. Once Hummingbot is running, you will be prompted to enter your exchange information. This includes the name of the exchange you are using and the trading pair you wish to trade.\\n\\n3. Next, you will be asked to configure the parameters for the pure market making strategy. These parameters include:\\n\\n   - `bid_spread`: This is how far away from the mid price you want to place the first bid order.\\n   - `ask_spread`: This is how far away from the mid price you want to place the first ask order.\\n   - `minimum_spread`: This is the minimum spread at which the bot will automatically cancel orders.\\n   - `order_refresh_time`: This is how often you want to cancel and replace bids and asks (in seconds).\\n   - `max_order_age`: This is how often you want to cancel and replace bids and asks with the same price (in seconds).\\n   - `order_refresh_tolerance_pct`: This is the percent change in price needed to refresh orders at each cycle.\\n   - `order_amount`: This is the amount of the base asset per order.\\n   - `price_ceiling`: This is the price point above which only sell orders will be placed.\\n   - `price_floor`: This is the price below which only buy orders will be placed.\\n\\n4. After configuring these parameters, the pure market making strategy will start running. It will place limit buy and sell orders on the order book at prices relative to the mid-price with spreads equal to the bid spread and ask spread. Every `order_refresh_time` seconds, the strategy replaces existing orders with new orders with refreshed spreads and order amounts.\\n\\n5. The strategy will continue to run until you stop it. You can monitor its performance and adjust the parameters as needed to optimize your market making strategy.\\n\\nRemember, market making involves a certain level of risk, so it's important to monitor your bot's performance and adjust your strategy as needed.\""

Enter the name of your maker spot connector.\\n\\n2. Select the trading pair: Enter the token trading pair you would like to trade on the chosen exchange.\\n\\n3. Set the bid and ask spread: Decide how far away from the mid price you want to place the first bid and ask orders. This is represented as a percentage.\\n\\n4. Set the minimum spread: This is the minimum spread at which the bot will automatically cancel orders.\\n\\n5. Set the order refresh time: This is the frequency at which you want to cancel and replace bids and asks. It is measured in seconds.\\n\\n6. Set the max order age: This is the frequency at which you want to cancel and replace bids and asks with the same price. It is also measured in seconds.\\n\\n7. Set the order refresh tolerance percentage: This is the percent change in price needed to refresh orders at each cycle.\\n\\n8.

Set the price band refresh time: This is the amount of time after which the price bands are reset based on the current price.\\n\\n12. Enable or disable the ping pong feature: If enabled, the bot will alternate between buy and sell orders after fills.\\n\\n13. Set the number of orders: This is the number of orders you want to place on both sides.\\n\\n14. Set the order level amount and spread: These are the amounts you want to increase or decrease the order size and price increments for each additional order.\\n\\n15.
